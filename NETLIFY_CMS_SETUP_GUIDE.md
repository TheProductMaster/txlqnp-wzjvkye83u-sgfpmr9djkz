## üñºÔ∏è Media Management

   - Automatically optimized for web

2. **Author Avatars:**
   - Upload through author avatar field
   - Recommended size: 300x300px
   - Circular crop applied automatically

### Image Optimization Tips

## üîÑ Build Process

### How It Works

1. **Content Creation:** Write posts in Netlify CMS
2. **Git Commit:** CMS commits markdown files to repository
3. **Build Trigger:** Netlify detects changes and rebuilds
4. **Processing:** `build-blog.js` converts markdown to JSON
5. **Deploy:** New content appears on your site

### Manual Build

```bash
# Process markdown files locally
npm run build:blog

# Full build with blog processing
npm run build
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Can't Access Admin:**
   - Ensure Netlify Identity is enabled
   - Check you're invited as a user
   - Verify Git Gateway is enabled

2. **Images Not Loading:**
   - Check file paths in `/public/uploads/`
   - Ensure images are uploaded through CMS
   - Verify image URLs in markdown frontmatter

3. **Posts Not Appearing:**
   - Check build logs in Netlify
   - Verify markdown frontmatter syntax
   - Ensure all required fields are filled

4. **Build Failures:**
   - Check `scripts/build-blog.js` for errors
   - Verify `gray-matter` dependency is installed
   - Review markdown syntax in posts

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if content directory exists
ls -la content/blog/

# Manually run blog build script
node scripts/build-blog.js

# Check generated JSON
cat public/data/blog-posts.json
```

  });
